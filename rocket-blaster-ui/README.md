# Rocket Blaster UI

A terminal-based alien detection system with interactive space blaster capabilities.

## Features

- Real-time alien detection scanning
- Colorful terminal interface
- Interactive space blaster mini-game
- Continuous monitoring of space sectors

## Usage

Run the script directly:

```bash
./scan_for_aliens.sh
```

Or use with Harmony:

```bash
harmony start alien-detector
```

## Requirements

- Bash shell
- Terminal with ANSI color support

## How it Works

The script simulates an alien detection system with a radar-like scanning animation. It has a random chance of detecting aliens, and when it does, you can engage the space blaster to neutralize the threat.

Even when no aliens are detected, the script displays a starfield animation and continues monitoring space sectors.
