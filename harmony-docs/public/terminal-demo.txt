Please replace this file with a terminal-demo.gif file that shows a recording of your CLI tool in action.

The GIF should:
1. Show common commands and their outputs
2. Be clear and readable
3. Demonstrate the key features of your CLI
4. Have a dark background to match the terminal styling
5. Be sized appropriately (recommended dimensions: 800x500px)

You can create a GIF using tools like:
- ScreenToGif (Windows)
- Gifox (Mac)
- Peek (Linux)
- Or online tools like Cloudapp or Gyazo

Once you have your GIF, replace this file with terminal-demo.gif in the same location.
